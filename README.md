# Dry-Air Silica gel
Dry Air system - project during internship


The project intends to practice re-using silica gel adsorption to produce pure oxygen gas - prototype version 

the system uses a simple microcontroller unit with atmega chip similar to arduino microcontroller controlling 
- air flow (valves)
- heating element 

simple sensing unit such as DHT 11 to sense 
- humidity
- temperature 
- air flow 

the objective of the system is to efficiently produce oxygen with a low-cost material with reheatable silica gel. 
- the use of silica gel is to serve as filtration gas and produce as much oxygen.
- while silica gel is reusable by reheating at temperature of 120 deg celcius turning from dark green (saturated - moisture) to orange (unsaturated - ready-use) color indication.

- the initial motivation of the project is to reach lower concentration of oxygen in comparison to industrial technique - oxygen concentrator called Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA).

the system is coded with C++ programming language interfaced using arduino IDE and booted into self replicated microcontroller resembling arduino. 

in this repository shows only the contribution code on MCU with basic programming logic at the time.
the project was done during internship period - Bachelor of Mechatronics 3rd year.
