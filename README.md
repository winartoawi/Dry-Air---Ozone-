# Dry-Air Ozone
Dry Air system - cost down project during internship


The project intends to practice re-using silica gel adsorption to produce pure oxygen gas - prototype version 

the system uses a simple microcontroller unit with atmega chip similar to arduino microcontroller controlling 
- air flow (valves)
- heating element 

the objective of the system is to efficiently produce oxygen with a low-cost material with reheatable silica gel. 
- the use of silica gel is to serve as filtration gas and produces only oxygen.
- while silica gel is reusable by reheating at temperature of 120 deg celcius turning from dark green (saturated - moisture) to orange (unsaturated - ready-use) color indication. 

the system is coded with C++ programming language interfaced using arduino IDE and booted into self replicated microcontroller resembling arduino. 

the project was done during internship period - Bachelor of Mechatronics 3rd year.
